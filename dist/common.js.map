The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\n *\n * A View has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\n * be applied along the way.\n *\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\n * and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`.\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\n * pinch-zooming for example.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * ### Changing the view state\n *\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\n *\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\n * rather than the corresponding setters. This will let view do its internal\n * computations. Besides, the `adjust*` methods also take an `opt_anchor`\n * argument which allows specifying an origin for the transformation.\n *\n * ### Interacting with the view\n *\n * View constraints are usually only applied when the view is *at rest*, meaning that\n * no interaction or animation is ongoing. As such, if the user puts the view in a\n * state that is not equivalent to a constrained one (e.g. rotating the view when\n * the snap angle is 0), an animation will be triggered at the interaction end to\n * put back the view to a stable state;\n *\n * @api\n */\nvar View = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(View, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n     */\n    function View(opt_options) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        var options = assign({}, opt_options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>}\n         */\n        _this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\n         */\n        _this.animations_ = [];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.updateAnimationKey_;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @const\n         * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\n         */\n        _this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetCenter_ = null;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetResolution_;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetRotation_;\n        _this.applyOptions_(options);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Set up the view with the given options.\n     * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\n     */\n    View.prototype.applyOptions_ = function (options) {\n        /**\n         * @type {Object<string, *>}\n         */\n        var properties = {};\n        var resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n         */\n        this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n        var centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\n        var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n        var rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Constraints}\n         */\n        this.constraints_ = {\n            center: centerConstraint,\n            resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n            rotation: rotationConstraint\n        };\n        this.setRotation(options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0);\n        this.setCenter(options.center !== undefined ? options.center : null);\n        if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n            this.setResolution(options.resolution);\n        }\n        else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n            this.setZoom(options.zoom);\n        }\n        this.resolveConstraints(0);\n        this.setProperties(properties);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {ViewOptions}\n         */\n        this.options_ = options;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.
